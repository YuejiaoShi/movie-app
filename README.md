# usePopcorn

usePopcorn is a dynamic React application for movie enthusiasts to discover, rate, and manage their movie-watching experiences. Leveraging the OMDB API (Open Movie Database), this app provides rich movie information and allows users to curate their watched movies list. Developed as part of a course by Jonas Schmedtmann, usePopcorn showcases fundamental React principles and custom hook implementations.
